"""Standalone entrypoint that runs one bounded gptme (github.com/gptme/gptme,
MIT) episode in-process and exits. Invoked by ``GptmeAdapter`` as a
subprocess of *this* script — never of a pre-built agent CLI binary —
exactly the way ``ClaudeCodeAdapter``/``CodexAdapter`` invoke `claude`/
`codex`, except the thing on the other end of the pipe is a few lines of
our own code calling a library function, not a product we don't control.

Why a subprocess at all, if the whole point was "no CLI in the loop"?
gptme's own ``chat()`` entrypoint does two things that make calling it
in-process, inline in the harness's event loop, actively unsafe:

1. It calls ``os.chdir(workspace)`` itself — a process-global mutation.
   Two concurrent episodes sharing our interpreter would race each other's
   cwd. A subprocess gets its own cwd for free; there is nothing to guard.
2. A real synchronous ``chat()`` call cannot be forcibly cancelled from
   asyncio — ``asyncio.wait_for``/``asyncio.timeout`` around
   ``asyncio.to_thread(chat, ...)`` only stops *awaiting* the result; the
   worker thread keeps running gptme's tool loop in the background,
   invisibly, after the harness has already moved on and released
   whatever lock was guarding the chdir above. A subprocess gets real
   ``EpisodeBudget`` enforcement for free too — ``environment/local.py``'s
   ``exec()`` already SIGTERMs/SIGKILLs the whole process group on
   timeout, the same mechanism every other adapter already relies on.

So this script exists purely to buy back subprocess isolation without
writing a second tool-calling loop ourselves — every actual decision
(which tool to call, when to stop) is still gptme's, not ours.

Reads the prompt from stdin (matching every other adapter's
``< {prompt_path}`` convention). Uses the current working directory as the
workspace — ``CommandAgentAdapter.run_episode`` already ``cd``s into
``workspace_path`` before running the command template, so there is
nothing left for this script to do about that. Always starts a fresh,
throwaway ``logdir`` (never reused across invocations): gptme's own
conversation log is a full-file rewrite on every append, not append-only/
fsync'd like this harness's ``EventLog``, so resuming into a half-written
log from a crashed attempt risks reading a torn file. ``GptmeAdapter`` has
no session-resume story for the same reason (see its docstring) — every
call here is an independent attempt, by design.

Emits ``--output-format json`` on stdout: one JSON object per message,
gptme's own documented line-delimited structured-output mode (the same
mode its own ``--output-format json`` CLI flag selects), not something
this script invents. ``gptme_adapter.py``'s ``gptme_visible_output``
parses that stream back out.

Also emits one ``{"type": "logdir", "logdir": "..."}`` line, first, before
``gptme.chat()`` starts. ``gptme_visible_output`` already ignores any line
whose ``type`` isn't ``"message"``, so this is invisible to it. It exists
so a live surface (the TUI) watching this line tee'd to the node's
``trace.jsonl`` (the same mechanism ``v0/runner.py``'s
``_watch_for_session_id`` already uses to watch for ``session_id``) can
discover *this attempt's* logdir while the episode is still running, and
append to ``<logdir>/prompt-queue.jsonl`` — gptme's own durable
mid-conversation prompt queue (``gptme/prompt_queue.py``), which
``gptme.chat()``'s loop already drains between turns. That's the whole
mechanism behind "talk to a running Writer/repair/research subagent
mid-episode": no fork of gptme's chat loop, just its own already-shipped
external-queue file, discovered via a path this script prints once.

def _wrap_thinking_stream(orig_stream):
    """Wrap gptme.llm._stream (or, in tests, a stand-in with the same
    shape) so `<think>`/`<thinking>` spans are intercepted and emitted as
    their own ``{"type": "thinking", ...}`` trace lines instead of sitting
    inert in the stored message content.

    Deliberately gptme-import-free and module-level (rather than a closure
    built inline in ``main()``, which is what this used to be): the actual
    interception logic only ever touches ``orig_stream``'s return value
    generically (a ``.gen`` attribute, if present) and never imports gptme
    itself, so it can be unit tested (``test_gptme_adapter.py``) without a
    real gptme install standing in the way.

    Two PLAN-AUDIT.md fixes live here:

    - **§E19**: gptme's own ``_StreamWithMetadata.__iter__`` reads a
      stream's usage/cost metadata back off its generator's
      ``StopIteration.value``. The original wrapper iterated with a plain
      ``for chunk in orig_gen: yield chunk``, which discards a generator's
      return value entirely -- metadata was always ``None`` downstream.
      Manually driving the generator with ``next()``/``except
      StopIteration`` (below) captures it. Also: a gptme version without a
      ``.gen`` attribute on its stream object (a shape change, or no
      ``_StreamWithMetadata`` at all) degrades to no live-thinking
      interception rather than raising and failing the whole episode.
    - **§E20l**: the detected `<think>`/`<thinking>` span is stripped out
      of what's yielded onward as `visible`, not just extracted and
      printed -- otherwise the raw tags also land in the stored message
      content, and ``dashboard/rendering.py``'s ``parse_trace`` extracts
      them a *second* time from there (the source of §E20j's now-deleted
      dedupe heuristic). Exactly one producer should ever emit "thinking".
