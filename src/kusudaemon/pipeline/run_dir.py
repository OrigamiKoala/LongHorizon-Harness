"""v5 run-directory path helpers (PLAN.md §5 extension).

Layer on top of v0-v4's helpers without touching them. Every path here is
plainly named after the file it points at; only ``source_path`` and
``run_spec_path`` are pre-touched (by the driver itself), the rest are
created by whichever module writes them, following v2's stated pattern of
never leaving a misleading empty file behind.

Files introduced by the driver you will not find in PLAN.md §5's layout:

* ``source.txt``     — the corpus the whole run decomposes (§4.2 feeds on
                       it). Written once at run start; nothing else touches it.
* ``phase.json``     — ``{"phase", "status", "detail", "ts"}``, the pipeline's
                       durable progress marker. Skipping a phase on resume is
                       decided by *artifact* existence (§10: markdown artifacts
                       are authoritative), not by this file's word, but it is
                       the fast path any watcher (CLI ``status``, the web app)
                       reads.
* ``approvals.jsonl`` — every human-in-the-loop checkpoint (intake answers,
                       pilot edits, amend/triage/reopen gates), append-only,
                       latest record per ``approval_id`` wins. Cross-process:
                       the driver polls it, the web app and the CLI append to
                       it, so any surface can resolve what any other surface
                       asked (§11: the web app "can be attached from anywhere").
* ``halt.flag``       — §10 "halt": stop after the current phase. The driver
                       checks it at phase boundaries only, never mid-turn.
* ``run.spec.json``   — the immutable ``{goal, source, backend, ...}`` record
                       of what the run was asked to do, written once at first
                       dispatch so a detached web app (or ``pipeline resume``)
                       can rebuild the environment (provider, adapter factory)
                       without the original command line.
