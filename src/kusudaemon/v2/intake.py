"""Intake (PLAN.md §A5, §B3): adaptive, bounded clarification driven by the
scope estimate's own findings, replacing this module's original design
(CLAUDE.md §4.1 / PLAN.md's own superseded description): a fixed seven-
dimension interview — one question call per dimension, then one finalize
call, 8 calls unconditionally, on every run, even a trivial one-line edit.

**What changed and why.** `v6/tiering.py`'s `estimate_scope` (§A4.2) already
makes one advisory model call per run and already asks it for
`ambiguities`/`objections`. The old design ignored that entirely and
re-derived its own fixed set of "audience/purpose/exclusions/..." questions
from scratch, regardless of whether the goal actually raised any of them —
"summarize a textbook" and "fix the typo on line 12" got the identical
8-call interview. This module now consumes the estimate's own findings
instead:

  1. If both `ambiguities` and `objections` are empty, intake spends zero
     calls — `pipeline/driver.py`'s `_phase_intake` handles that branch
     itself (`_write_minimal_spec`), never calling into this module at all.
  2. Otherwise, exactly one `complete_json` call (`build_question_set`)
     turns them into a **bounded question set**: 0–4 questions, each
     carrying its own `default_assumption` — what to assume if the
     question goes unanswered — which is what lets this design skip the old
     design's second "finalize" call entirely; the default assumption is
     already in hand at question-generation time, no second round-trip
     needed to fill in blanks after the fact.
  3. The same call restates the estimate's free-text `objections` as
     concrete conflicts, `{claim, why, options[]}` (§A5's own schema) — the
     model saying "this goal contradicts itself" is a schema field, not an
     instruction to be polite about it.
  4. The harness posts **one approval per round**, carrying every question
     in that round (`Approval.questions`/`.answers`, `pipeline/approvals.py`)
     — a form, not N sequential blocking prompts.
  5. `MAX_INTAKE_ROUNDS = 2`, a code constant. Round 2 fires only if round 1
     produced at least one non-blank answer *and* a fresh
     `build_question_set` call (fed round 1's transcript, so it can ask
     genuine follow-ups rather than re-deriving the same questions) still
     returns questions. A silent operator (zero non-blank answers) ends
     intake after round 1 rather than being asked again.
  6. Every question that never gets a non-blank answer, in whichever round
     it was last asked, becomes an assumption line built from its own
     `default_assumption` — `CLAUDE.md` §4.1's best property, kept
     unchanged: "no unstated assumptions" holds without an unbounded
     interview.
  7. Objections are shown to the operator inside the same approval's
     message (there is no separate per-objection "acknowledge" action in
     this implementation — see the docstring on `run_intake` for why) and,
     unconditionally, copied into `spec.md` under `## Unresolved
     objections`, which `pipeline/prompts.py`'s `_goal_and_rubric_block`
     already renders into every downstream Writer's prompt (that consumer
     was built ahead of this module, per PLAN.md §D1, specifically waiting
     for this heading to start existing).

Cost: 0 calls in the common case, 1–2 when the goal is genuinely unclear —
against 8 unconditionally before (§B3's ship gate: mean < 3 across five
varied goals).

    has already established `ambiguities`/`objections` is non-empty — the
    zero-call skip path is `_write_minimal_spec`, not this function, so this
    module never has to re-decide "should intake run at all," only "how
    many rounds."

    Round loop, `MAX_INTAKE_ROUNDS`-capped in code, never by the model
    deciding it's satisfied (§A5.4): round 1 always runs (that's what being
    called at all means); round 2 runs only if round 1 produced at least
    one non-blank answer *and* a fresh `build_question_set` call still
    returns questions — "a silent operator ends intake immediately rather
    than being asked again."

    `initial_question_set` (A5-2, IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-COST-AND-LIVE.md): a
    round-1 QuestionSet that the classify call already produced (the merged
    `estimate_scope_full`). When given, round 1 skips `build_question_set`
    entirely — the questions/objections are already in hand — and only a
    round 2 calls it (fed round 1's transcript, per the docstring on
    `build_question_set`). The `ambiguities`/`objections` params are then
    unused; they remain for the legacy call path (round 1 builds its own
    question set from them).

    **Objections have no separate acknowledge/dismiss action in this
    implementation.** §A5 leaves that choice open ("if you want an operator
    to be able to explicitly acknowledge/address one, decide and document
    your approach"). The design here: objections are shown to the operator
    in the same approval as the round's questions (so they reach the
    operator and are visible before any question gets answered — the §B3
    ship gate's "a deliberately self-contradictory goal produces an
    objection the operator agrees with"), and every objection the estimate
    raised is copied into `spec.md`'s `## Unresolved objections`
    unconditionally at the end of intake. An operator "agreeing" with an
    objection during a round means it's now on record for every downstream
    Writer to see — not that it silently stops being surfaced. Building a
    real resolved/unresolved state machine per objection is future work,
    not required by the ship gate as written.
