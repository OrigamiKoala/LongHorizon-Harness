"""Scoped repair (PLAN.md §4.5, §4.6, §10).

A repair targets one already-produced node with a **scoped, located**
defect ("§Worked Examples, example 2 omits the intermediate step") and is
instructed to make the minimal change — freeform prose suggestions get
over-applied and drift the artifact away from what already passed review
(§4.5). It then goes back through the same gates + review any writer
dispatch does (§4.6: "which goes back through review"), and only replaces
the live artifact once that succeeds.

**Why this can't just call v0's ``run_node`` again with the node's own
id.** ``run_node`` is keyed by node id in ``events.jsonl``; once a node has
an ``episode_completed`` event (true for anything reaching this module —
repair only ever targets a node that already passed once), calling
``run_node`` again on that same id is defined to be a no-op replay of the
old result (v0/runner.py's whole resumability contract). So a repair
attempt dispatches under a *derived* id
(``"<node id>~repair<attempt>"``, attempt = ``node.attempts + 1``, reusing
the same counter v1's round loop already increments on failed
submits/reviews) — a fresh id v0 has never seen, hence a fresh dispatch —
and then this module copies the resulting text over the real artifact path
once it's confirmed good. This is also what makes the derived id
deterministic across a crash mid-repair: retrying with the same
``node.attempts`` value lands on the same id, so v0's own resume machinery
still applies to the repair dispatch itself.

**The guardrail this preserves** (§4.6: "the assembler's file tools are
read-only over ``out/``... otherwise the assembler 'helpfully' edits
content to make the build green and you ship a passing compile over
corrupted content that already passed review"): the *assembler* (compile.py,
checks.py, assemble.py) never writes into ``out/`` itself. Only a repair
*writer* — dispatched here, through gates and review exactly like any other
writer node — is allowed to change a passed artifact, and only after its
output re-clears both bars.

Snapshotting (§4.6: "snapshot to ``out/.versions/`` before any repair" —
"if the amendment was itself the mistake, you'll only realize it three
chapters in") happens unconditionally, before the repair writer is even
dispatched, so a bad repair or a bad contract amendment is always
recoverable.
