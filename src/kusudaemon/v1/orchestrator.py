"""Orchestrator role (PLAN.md §3, §13 v1 scope).

Stateless per round: fresh context every round, rebuilt from disk, one
small schema-constrained JSON decision, discarded. Cost is bounded by the
ready-set size, **not** the tree size (PLAN-zeromem.md §1.8): ``_compact_state``
lists every ready node in full and only per-status counts of the rest, so a
400-node tree costs the same per round as a 20-node one — a few K tokens,
not ~40K.

This is *not* where "done" gets decided. PLAN.md invariant 1: only the
harness writes ``status: passed``, and only after gates evaluate — so a
"dispatch" decision naming a node id outside the harness-computed ready set
is corrected by code, not trusted (invariant 2: "gated by code, not by
model judgment").

PLAN-zeromem.md §1 makes that whole call optional: ``decide_next_action_*
deterministic`` performs the same halt/escalate arbitration (already
code-side) and picks the first ready node — which, by construction
(``v2/planner.py`` writes tree.json in spine order and leaves carry
``depends_on=[]``), is the earliest unfinished node in document order.
