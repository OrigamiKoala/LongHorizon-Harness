"""The v1 round loop (PLAN.md §13): Orchestrator/Writer/Reviewer driven one
round at a time, task state kept entirely in ``tree.json``.

Resumability (§10) composes with v0 rather than reimplementing it:

- A node already "passed" is never revisited — ``TaskTree.is_ready`` only
  offers "pending" nodes to the orchestrator.
- A node caught mid-flight by a crash (its ``tree.json`` status is still
  "dispatched" or "awaiting_review" when this process starts) is resumed
  directly, *before* the orchestrator is asked anything this round —
  dispatch decisions are for new work, not for continuing what was already
  underway. The in-flight writer continuation itself is v0's ``run_node``,
  completely unmodified: it replays from ``events.jsonl`` exactly as it
  does for a single-node run.

Invariant enforced here, not by either role (PLAN.md §2 invariant 1): a
node's status only ever becomes "passed" after both its gates (code) and
its reviewer verdict (model, only consulted when the node declares
judgment items) agree.

``_transition_after_writer``/``_transition_after_review`` also record the
located gate or reviewer failure onto ``node.last_defect`` on every failed
attempt, and clear it on success (PLAN-zeromem.md §9) — a retry's prompt
(``pipeline/prompts.py:build_node_prompt``) reads it back, so attempts 2
and 3 carry forward what attempt 1 got wrong instead of resampling an
identical prompt blind.

``dispatch_node``/``review_and_transition_node`` (PLAN.md §B2) are
``run_round_loop``'s per-node dispatch/review bodies, pulled out of their
original inline closures into standalone functions — the *only* change
this made to this module's own behavior is that they're callable directly.
This exists so ``v6/direct.py``'s T0 direct-episode path (one gated
episode, no ``tree.json``) can reuse the exact same Writer-dispatch and
Reviewer-verdict machinery instead of re-implementing it: T0 hands both
functions an in-memory, single-node ``TaskTree`` and a JSON path of its own
choosing (never named ``tree.json`` — PLAN.md §A4.3: "T0 has no
``tree.json``"), and gets the identical gate-cache-write, manifest-line,
and status-transition behavior a real round-loop dispatch gets.

**Runtime split (PLAN.md §A8/§B5) is wired here as two optional, injected
callables — ``split_handler`` and ``on_node_passed`` — never as a direct
import of ``v7/split.py``.** This package's layering is strictly
bottom-up (``v0`` -> ``v1`` -> ``v2`` -> ...; grep any ``v1/*.py`` and none
of them import from ``v2`` or later), and ``v7/split.py`` needs ``TaskTree``/
``TaskNode`` from here plus ``leaf_gate`` from ``v2/planner.py`` — so this
module cannot import it without inverting that rule. Instead
``dispatch_node`` and ``review_and_transition_node`` accept the real
functions as parameters, and ``pipeline/driver.py`` (which already imports
both ``v1`` and ``v7``) is the one place that wires
``v7.split.handle_split_proposal``/``v7.split.maybe_derive_split_parent``
in — and only for the T2/T3 tiers, never for T0/T1 (``v6/direct.py``'s own
calls to these two functions never pass either callable, so its behavior
is byte-for-byte unchanged: PLAN.md §A8.1's mechanism only makes sense
against a real, multi-node-capable ``tree.json``, which T0 has none of and
T1's is a single node the driver builds directly with its own, different,
already-built escalation path — ``v6/direct.py:is_size_defect`` /
``size_defect_retry``). Left ``None`` (every existing caller of these three
functions, and every test of this module before §B5), ``split_handler``/
``on_node_passed`` cost nothing and change nothing: split detection is
purely additive.

``split_handler(run_dir, node, tree, tree_path, log) -> bool`` runs right
after the Writer episode returns, before gate evaluation — a split
proposal is a third kind of episode termination (submit / split / fail,
§A8.1), and gate-evaluating a blank ``out/<node>.md`` from a node that
proposed a split instead of submitting would misread it as a plain
"fail" and burn an attempt PLAN.md explicitly says a rejected proposal
must not cost. Returning ``True`` means a ``split.json`` was present and
fully handled (accepted-and-grafted, or evaluated-and-rejected) — either
way ``dispatch_node`` returns immediately without touching gates, the
manifest, or ``_transition_after_writer``. Returning ``False`` means no
``split.json`` existed at all, and ``dispatch_node`` proceeds exactly as
before this workstream.

``on_node_passed(run_dir, node, tree, tree_path, log) -> None`` runs
inside ``review_and_transition_node`` immediately after a node's status
becomes "passed" — the natural place to ask "did this completion just
finish off a split parent's last outstanding child," mirroring how
dependency-based readiness (``TaskTree.is_ready``) is already re-checked
reactively rather than polled. Re-checking on every passing node (instead
of tracking "is this the last one" explicitly) is deliberately the simple
option: the condition itself (``all(sibling.status == "passed" for
sibling in siblings)``) is cheap and idempotent to recompute, so there is
nothing to get out of sync.

    PLAN-AUDIT.md §E15: ``should_halt`` (default ``None``, byte-identical to
    every pre-§E15 caller and test — nothing calls it, this loop never
    halts) lets an operator's Halt control take effect *inside* a long
    ``execute`` phase instead of only at the driver's phase boundaries.
    Checked at three points, none of which interrupt a turn already in
    flight (PLAN.md §10 "never interrupt mid-turn"): (a) before each
    round's orchestrator dispatch decision, (b) before that round's wave is
    marked dispatched and actually sent out, and (c) before each iteration
    of the in-place attempt-retry loop. A hit only ever skips *starting*
    new work — any ``dispatch``/``review`` already awaited runs to
    completion — and the tree is returned exactly as it stood at the halt
    point: nothing is marked failed or blocked on account of halting.

    PLAN.md §C2: ``max_parallel > 1`` runs each round as a **wave** — the
    orchestrator's dispatch decision (one call, exactly as before) names
    the first node, and the wave is filled out to ``max_parallel`` with the
    next ready nodes in tree order, picked by code from the ready set with
    **no additional model calls** (the orchestrator was never the
    bottleneck, and §2 keeps its context bounded by the ready set; writer
    throughput is the thing parallelism buys). The wave's subprocess
    episodes run concurrently via ``asyncio.gather`` in
    ``max_parallel``-sized chunks, then the wave's reviews run the same
    way. ``max_parallel=1`` is the byte-identical event sequence to the
    pre-§C2 loop: chunks of one are sequential awaits in the same order.

    Concurrency guards (all inert at ``max_parallel=1``):
    - ``EventLog`` serializes appends with its own ``threading.Lock``
      (``v0/events.py``).
    - every ``tree.save`` funnels through one ``asyncio.Lock``
      (``_save_tree_locked``) — the "single-writer discipline".
    - the state mutation + save sequences are synchronous on the single
      event-loop thread (no awaits between them), which is the deeper
      guarantee; the lock is the spec'd fence that holds even if that
      changes.
    - ``provider_concurrency`` (default: unlimited) bounds simultaneous
      provider calls via an ``asyncio.Semaphore`` around review verdicts.
      Inert today — the provider is synchronous urllib, so calls cannot
      overlap on one thread — and load-bearing only once the provider
      goes async or calls move onto threads.
    - an assertion that no two in-flight (wave) nodes share an artifact
      path, so a future @D0 regression (``artifact != out/<id>.md``)
      cannot silently clobber one artifact with another's write.
