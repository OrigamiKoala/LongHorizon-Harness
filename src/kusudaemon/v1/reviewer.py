"""Reviewer role (PLAN.md §3, §6, §7).

Sees the artifact plus the node's judgment rubric only — never the writer's
reasoning or scratch (§3: "A reviewer that can see the writer's
justification talks itself into accepting"). Cannot write; it returns
scoped, located defects only (§4.5) via the §6 verdict schema.

If a node declares no judgment items, gates (already machine-checked in
code before review ever runs) are the entire exit condition, so review is
skipped rather than spending a call manufacturing an opinion nobody asked
for.

PLAN.md §A9/§B6: an over-cap artifact fans out by top-level heading into
<=``MAX_FANOUT_SECTIONS`` sections, one call each against the same rubric,
merged by union-of-items / all-pass — replacing the old whole-artifact
truncation (§D5's interim fix), which is kept only as the last-resort
fallback for an artifact with no headings to split on. Bounded, one level,
no recursion — the only place a reviewer fans out at all (§A9: "unbounded
reviewer recursion is explicitly rejected").

    ``cap_artifact_text`` to make this decision is deliberate: it is the
    same threshold logic §D5's interim fix already shipped, so "under cap"
    here means exactly what it always has, no new off-by-one to reason
    about).

    Over cap: split by top-level heading into <=``MAX_FANOUT_SECTIONS``
    sections (§A9's fan-out), one ``review_node``-shaped call per section
    against the *same* full rubric (a defect can be anywhere; sections
    aren't independently rubric-scoped, just token-scoped), then merge:
    ``items`` is the union of every section's items (no dedup — two
    sections independently flagging the same real defect is not obviously
    wrong, and a dedup heuristic risks dropping a distinct one), ``verdict``
    is "pass" only if every section passed. This is what makes a defect in
    the artifact's last 20% visible at all: today it is past the cut and
    structurally invisible; fan-out sends every byte to some call.

    No headings at all: falls back to §D5's interim plain truncation
    (documented, honest degrade — matches this codebase's convention for
    a fallback with no better option, e.g. ``pipeline/prompts.py``'s
    inline-spans fallback or ``v2/planner.py``'s gap-fill).

    A pathological single (post-grouping) section still over cap after
    fan-out: truncate just that section rather than fail the review
    outright. ``truncated`` is ``True`` only in these last two cases —
