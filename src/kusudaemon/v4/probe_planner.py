"""§C3 — the probe planner (windowed, model-driven targeting).

PLAN.md §C3 (line 634):

    `needs_probe(node)` deterministic filter, then one windowed
    `complete_json` per 60 candidate nodes — not one call per node. Now serves
    §A6's targeted exploration as well as web research.

§A6's "targeted exploration" bullet (line 298–299) names this module's
role explicitly:

    Targeted exploration (post-intake, T1+): probes for specific open
    questions, selected by the windowed planner carried over as §C3.

What that means concretely. The *structural* exploration that §B4 shipped
(``driver.py:_run_structural_exploration``) is **code-scheduled**: one
probe per top-level spine unit, decided entirely by the harness. Targeted
exploration is the model-scheduled counterpart — the planner reads a
slice of the candidate node set and decides which of those nodes would
benefit from a probe, and what the probe should ask. Both feed the same
``run_research_loop`` afterwards; the only difference is who picked the
targets.

Three cost-shaped rules, all from the §C3 spec line:

1. **One windowed call per 60 candidate nodes.** ``window_indices`` over
   the candidate list with ``window=stride=60`` (no overlap — a probe
   suggestion is a property of a single node, not a boundary between two;
   an overlap window here would pay two calls for one decision). This is
   the same "scale with windows, not with nodes" rule
   ``v3/document_review.py`` already codified for the cross-leaf pass.
2. **``needs_probe(node)`` is deterministic and code-side** — the model
   never decides *which* nodes are candidates, only which candidates
   should be probed. Same invariant as ``orchestrator.py``'s ready-set:
   the harness constrains inputs, the model picks among them.
3. **Returned node ids are validated against the window slice** — unknown
   ids are dropped and logged, exactly the way
   ``document_review.py:absorb`` drops unknown ``node_ids``. The model
   picking a node outside its window would be a model judging something
   it was not shown (invariant 2's failure mode), not a probe suggestion.

This module is a pure library: it produces a ``ResearchPlan`` of the
exact shape ``v4/research_loop.py:run_research_loop`` already accepts.
Wiring it into ``_phase_research`` is the driver's job (a single
conditional that builds the plan from candidates when the operator did
not supply one explicitly — see that phase's own docstring).

    A node is a probe candidate iff it carries some structural signal a
    probe could productively follow up on. The filter is deliberately
    **wide** (a model window then decides which candidates to actually
    probe) — false positives are cheap (one extra line per candidate in
    a 60-node window), false negatives are not (a node the filter drops
    is never shown to the model, so a probe that would have helped is
    structurally invisible).

    Concretely a node is a candidate when **all** of:

    - brief has >= ``_MIN_BRIEF_WORDS`` words — a one-line "Produce the
      artifact for X" brief has nothing to probe, and a three-word brief
      would make the model invent a question rather than identify one
    - shape matches one of the structural markers (``problem-set``,
      ``derivation``, ``reference``, ``code``, ``api``, ``specification``)
